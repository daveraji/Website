<h2 id='essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less' class='collapsible'>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</h2>
<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is meant to help you simplify your life and achieve your dreams faster and easier. Very conventional self help book in that sense but its method is simple, cut out anything unnecessary. You can do this in a few ways: Consistently challenge assumptions you have about what you want, get really, *really* good at saying no, and focus on your yes with full focus. 
</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> This whole book was really convincing to me to be honest. This reminded me of the Ruthless Elimination of Hurry and the question of keeping the main thing the main thing. Greg McKeown does not pull punches and is very direct in the action items in this book. Highlights were the chapters on making a mission statement, saying no graciously and the idea that you should even say no to *good* things that aren’t the essential thing. I’m learning more and more that my time is being constantly siphoned and I can't do the things that I, myself, deem essential. Very impactful book.

<h2 id='nonviolent-communication' class='collapsible'>NonViolent Communication</h2>
<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#nonviolent-communication'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>Question:</b> How can you have a better approach to communication to better address the needs of all parties without causing people to get defensive?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is trying to help anyone better communicate their needs effectively and help the people in their lives to recognize those needs and emotions as well as become biased to help them. The book goes through different techniques that help the reader efficiently let people know how they feel while avoiding the pitfalls that conventionally can lead to people getting defensive and avoiding resolution or even an understanding. The methods are used for handling conflict and unpleasant feelings and also expressing gratitude and explaining positive emotions. The book also goes through examples of these techniques in action which helps paint a picture of what our world could look like with more effective Non-violent communication. The book helps you to communicate with others and yourself using the following framework: I feel [emotion], when you [did specific action] and this stems from [universal need that explains my reaction to the event].
</p>
<p><b>Fascinating idea:</b> When I read this book I thought it'd help me communicate with others. What it really helped me do was introspect so much better. I had to take a majority of my time here thinking about what my needs actually are and how to actually put them into words. Also getting in tune with my emotions on a discrete level. I initially referred to every bad emotion as nervous instead of disappointment, angry, disgusted etc. A chart doing the breakdown of different emotions helped me better understand my own feelings.

<h2 id='uncanny-valley-anna-weiner' class='collapsible'>Uncanny Valley - Anna Weiner</h2>
<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#uncanny-valley-anna-weiner'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question:</b> What does Silicon Valley look like to the world? What's up with this place and culture?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is the memoir of Anna Weiner. She is initially a floating 25 year old in NYC working at some dead-end jobs in publishing. She joins a startup, and this starts her adventure through Silicon Valley. She ends up having a pure silicon valley experience: startup grinds, lucrative acquisitions and even becoming good friends with founders. Throughout the experience she asks, “what's the point?”.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> One thing that this author gets at without mentioning outright, is the idea that very few ideas in silicon valley are actually novel. Uber is taxis, Airbnb is a bed and breakfast, social media is just human interactions and sharing, and even github was already being done before - the main provision is that these things are now centralized. Fundamentally, the actions that humans take aren't all that different. The change is that we do it all through one device and we’re tracked while doing it. I guess this always presents a possibility to opt out since the world isn’t really that different when you do.

<h2 id='why-were-polarized-ezra-klein' class='collapsible'>Why We're Polarized - Ezra Klein</h2>
<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#why-were-polarized-ezra-klein'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question: </b> How do we define polarization? Has it been increasing and if so, what does that mean for
    American politics? </p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Ezra Klein is really smart. In this book, he walks us throught the history of polarization in
    America. The book talks about things that contribute to polarization as well as presents lots of psychological
    evidence to explain current trends and predict the future of politics. </p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> One of the compelling ideas was the breakdown of Identity Politics. Klein argues that
    conservatism in the US isn't a set of principles but actually an identity. It's reflected by how homogenous the
    American Republic party looks (mostly white middle-aged men). He argues that the Democrats have a harder time
    building a single-identity coalition like this so they have to moderate their tone, so what they say to encourage
    black people doesn't dissuade their Hispanic working-class coalition etc etc. This also kind of explains that phrase
    "Democrats fall in love, republicans fall in line." Party loyalty might be more pertinent when it's a big part of
    the group identity.</p>

<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#the-feminine-mystique---Betty-Friedman'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question: </b>Why is it that 40 years after the women's suffrage movement and the “first wave” of feminism, more women
than ever felt unfulfilled with how limited the scope of their lives were.</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Betty Freidman is a research juggernaut. This book is just throwing haymakers in terms of examples and case
studies on and one. Now, I’m not necessarily privy to the world of these upper-middle class white women from the 60’s,
but Betty paints a distinctly human experience in their frustrations. She makes her points that women should be a more
prominent part of global society by drawing from a ton of research, and a veritable cacophony of voices/interviews.
Realtalk, this book was longer than I thought it’d be. There was just *so much* content. If anyone is trying to
understand that second wave, RBG, ERA type of white feminism - this book is their bible.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Betty takes on Freud in a way that I hadn’t thought about before. It was a great chapter about how
Freud’s biological conclusions are bogus especially when it comes to how it determined women’s interactions. She
straight up says that Freud doesn’t understand women. I totally believe it! She talked about his strange relationship
with his own wife, mother and sisters. How those power imbalances informed his perceptions. She even critiques how his
actions aren’t even consistent with his own findings. Definitely made me second guess that version of
pseudo-intellectualism and behavioural psychology.</p>

<h2 id='when-breath-becomes-air' class='collapsible'>When Breath Becomes Air</h2>
<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#when-breath-becomes-air'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question:</b> What's it like to die? How does the process of dying inform life?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The book follows an aspiring brain surgeon who finds out that he has a late stage metastasized brain cancer.
Paul Kalanithi tells his life and his story through diagnoses and finally death. This book was just gut-wrenching. So
real. Incredibly beautiful and relevant. Reading this made me want to take back my time from inconsequential activities
like social media and mindless tv. Also Paul was a great writer, him talking about life and legacy really helped open my
mind and think about life's bigger questions and answers.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> In the book, Paul describes this panic when he realizes that he's been preparing for a role
(neurosurgeon) that inherently takes a long, long time to realize and that he went through the grind but will miss out
on the glory. He talks about loving your work, embracing the journey. Changed how I thought about my career. Less as a
destination to reach but more as a story to enjoy in the present. Also, finding things I enjoy now, instead of just
constantly delaying gratification for delaying sake. Take vacations, leave toxic environments, spend some money on
yourself; this book left me with the idea that life is short so we ought to enjoy the journey.</p>

<h2 id='the-inconvenient-indian' class='collapsible'>The Inconvenient Indian</h2>
<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#the-inconvenient-indian'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question:</b> What is the relationship between Indigineous people in North America and non-Indigenous people based on?
What’s all this history like and what is the resulting perspective of American Indigineous folks.</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is more than just an historical anthology. The writer, Thomas King, does a stellar job of talking
about historical stories while explaining the context from an Indigenous perspective. The book is an absolute banger, a
gut-wrenching crash course in Indigenous history and also present context. He talks about some serious mistreatment of
Native peoples with such transparency and clarity that shows he’s not in the business of softening the discussion for
white people. This book is the definition of real. We as North Americans need to be better.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> As King himself mentions at the end of the book “It’s all about the land”. The relationship between
Indigineous people and their land is fundamentally different than a fee-simple commodity. The book explained how
communal land sharing and tribal structures are ingrained in the Indigineous experience and how problematic legislative
actions in the US and Canada are systematically ripping those away. Big eye-opener.</p>

<h2 id='the-smart-enough-city' class='collapsible'>The Smart Enough City</h2>
<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#the-smart-enough-city'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question:</b> Are we trippin’? Why do we need all this useless technology in our cities? Is it even really helpful or is
getting in the way of our actual civic work and endangering our privacy?</p>
<p><b>Summary: </b>This book talks about city tech. Basically goes through examples of city bureaucrats adding public space wifi,
cameras everywhere or “AI” to cities in order to bring them up to date. The book talks about “tech goggles” that people
sometimes have where they just think that adding more tech to something will immediately make it better. Turns out
that’s not the case, sometimes.. Well, often actually - it makes it worse. This book talks about some downright terrible
examples of that *cough* sidewalk labs *cough* and then at the end highlights some good use cases!</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Privacy considerations of using technology in the public domain. People can use taxi data to find out
who frequents strip clubs and then extort them and ruin their political careers, for some reason. Police use facial
recognition data to punish people for attending protests against police brutality. Fighting the idea that there is
police brutality by.. being brutal. This book did a great job of explaining the importance of privacy and why you should
care about it even if you believe you have nothing to hide.</p>

<div class='content'><small>[<a href='#men-explain-things-to-me'>link</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question:</b> Why are men the way that they are?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is a collection of essays about feminism. Absolutely solid. It’s author is credited for the word
‘mansplaining’, although she apparently isn’t a big fan of its use. From microagressions to violence against women and a
crystal clear explanation of how they’re all woven together. Book really helped paint a picture of the butterfly effect
of misogynist violence. How letting this joke slide now relates to acts of physical violence against women later.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea: </b>Reading this book was just a total revelation. Being a better ally definitely starts with knowledge.
I’m low-key ashamed to say, I wasn’t as knowledgeable as I thought on women’s studies and history. Understand the
pattern and you can more quickly call it out. Understand the history and you can better empathize with the gravitas of
the inequality. Also big-ups to the author for acknowledging and discussing the different experiences of feminism for
Black and Indigenous women. Highly recommend the read.</p>
