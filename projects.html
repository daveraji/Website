                <h2>Summary</h2>
        </center>
        <p>I'm a software product leader currently working in the healthcare space. I come from a wide range of
            experience. My superpower is simplifying product releases to deliver the most value with the limited
            resources available. </p><br><p>
            I am passionate about learning new technologies, motivated by customer success and
            world-changing scalable applications.
            My goal is to develop technology that makes the word more accessible, productive and
            fulfilling.

				<h3>Book Blog</h3>
				<p><strong><a href="blog.html">thismonthsbook.com</a></strong>
					(<em>Ongoing Blog</em>)<br />
					I had a New Year's Resolution in January 2020 to read a book a month. I'm
					using this blog as a way to capture the ideas that I learn and inspire others
					to read a book a month as well. It started as a separate website till I integrated with my personal
					site. </p>

				<h3>Product Analysis:  Building an SSO system for SaaS tools </h3>
				<p><strong><a href="https://daveraji.medium.com/product-analysis-building-an-sso-system-for-saas-tools-c37416667e98">Medium</a></strong>
					(<em>Oct 2023</em>)<br />
					Another exploration into the balance between productivity and security in the implementation of SaaS apps. 
					In this product analysis, I look into what it's like to implement an SSO and why it might be favourable for building a Saas tool.

				<h3>Product Analysis: The Identity Access Management Migration Problem </h3>
				<p><strong><a href="https://daveraji.medium.com/product-analysis-the-identity-access-management-migration-problem-2c2de2657951">Medium</a></strong>
					(<em>July 2023</em>)<br />
					An overdue extension to the product analysis series. This time I wanted to start exploring aspects
				of software and technology that we take for granted. I initially just wanted to look into cybersecurity and 
			Identity Access Management and the exploration went into an interesting business problem. </p>

				<h3>Product Analysis: Yelp</h3>
				<p><strong><a href="https://daveraji.medium.com/product-analysis-yelp-93da3e39f61f">Medium</a></strong>
					(<em>May 2021</em>)<br />
					I wanted to flex my Product Management muscles by doing product analyses
					for software that I use.
					The idea is to use my working knowledge and a bit of research into the
					business to identify stakeholders,
					accentuate things that are going well and areas of growth. </p>

				<h3>What is Discrimination</h3>
				<p><strong><a href="https://half-interested.blogspot.com/2020/12/what-is-discrimination.html" target="_blank"
							rel="noopener noreferrer">Half Interested </a></strong>
					(<em>Dec 2020</em>)<br />
					Google fired their leading AI Ethicist and there was discussion online
					about if this
					was discriminatory. I wrote about evaluating that claim and drew some
					conclusions about
					it's application.</p>

							target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a></strong>
					(<em>March 2019</em>)<br />
					A law was passed by the EU governing copyright laws of content. This
					shifted the onus to technology
					companies to police their own platforms. I give an overview and give my
					thoughts on the implications.</p>

				<h3>Project Migration </h3>
				<p><strong>GE HealthCare</strong>
					<em>Dec 2020</em><br />
					The old version of our app was being upgraded from a backend of DynamoDB
					to mySQL.
					Customer data needed to be migrated so that when we made the switch,
					there would
					be no disruption to the customer process.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Wrote SDK for creating Projects, Jobs, Tasks and TaskItems in our
						new system APIs</li>
					<li>Wrote the logic for Task Migration, Job Deletion, Automatic
						archiving and Validation Scripts
						for both the cloud environment and local runs
					</li>
					<li>Ran Migration on the cloud through an AWS Lambda, archiving in S3 as
						we went</li>
