				<h3>Book Blog</h3>
				<p><strong><a href="blog.html">thismonthsbook.com</a></strong>
					(<em>Ongoing Blog</em>)<br />
					I had a New Year's Resolution in January 2020 to read a book a month. I'm
					using this blog as a way to capture the ideas that I learn and inspire others
					to read a book a month as well. It started as a separate website till I integrated with my personal
					site. </p>

				<h3>Yelp Product Analysis </h3>
				<p><strong><a href="https://daveraji.medium.com/product-analysis-yelp-93da3e39f61f">Medium</a></strong>
					(<em>May 2021</em>)<br />
					I wanted to flex my Product Management muscles by doing product analyses
					for software that I use.
					The idea is to use my working knowledge and a bit of research into the
					business to identify stakeholders,
					accentuate things that are going well and areas of growth. The first of
					the series in on Yelp.</p>

				<h3>What is Discrimination</h3>
				<p><strong><a href="https://www.halfinterested.com/what-is-discrimination/" target="_blank"

					(<em>Dec 2020</em>)<br />
					Google fired their leading AI Ethicist and there was discussion online
					about if this
					was discriminatory. I wrote about evaluating that claim and drew some
					conclusions about
					it's application.</p>

					(<em>March 2019</em>)<br />
					A law was passed by the EU governing copyright laws of content. This
					shifted the onus to technology
					companies to police their own platforms. I give an overview and give my
					thoughts on the implications.</p>

				<h3>Project Migration </h3>
				<p><strong>GE HealthCare</strong>
					<em>Dec 2020</em><br />
					The old version of our app was being upgraded from a backend of DynamoDB
					to mySQL.
					Customer data needed to be migrated so that when we made the switch,
					there would
					be no disruption to the customer process.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Wrote SDK for creating Projects, Jobs, Tasks and TaskItems in our
						new system APIs</li>
					<li>Wrote the logic for Task Migration, Job Deletion, Automatic
						archiving and Validation Scripts
						for both the cloud environment and local runs
					</li>
					<li>Ran Migration on the cloud through an AWS Lambda, archiving in S3 as
						we went</li>
