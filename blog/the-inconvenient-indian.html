<h1>The Inconvenient Indian</h1>

<p><b>The Question:</b> What is the relationship between Indigineous people in North America and non-Indigenous people based on?
What’s all this history like and what is the resulting perspective of American Indigineous folks.</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is more than just an historical anthology. The writer, Thomas King, does a stellar job of talking
about historical stories while explaining the context from an Indigenous perspective. The book is an absolute banger, a
gut-wrenching crash course in Indigenous history and also present context. He talks about some serious mistreatment of
Native peoples with such transparency and clarity that shows he’s not in the business of softening the discussion for
white people. This book is the definition of real. We as North Americans need to be better.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> As King himself mentions at the end of the book “It’s all about the land”. The relationship between
Indigineous people and their land is fundamentally different than a fee-simple commodity. The book explained how
communal land sharing and tribal structures are ingrained in the Indigineous experience and how problematic legislative
actions in the US and Canada are systematically ripping those away. Big eye-opener.</p>
