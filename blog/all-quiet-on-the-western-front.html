<p><b>Question:</b> What was it like to be a young man in 1917 volunteering for World War 1 and fighting for Germany? What’s it like to fight a losing war in general? 
</p><p><b>Summary:</b> This book took you through the journey of a young scholar who is encouraged by his teacher to join the war with his classmates. The book goes through in excruciating detail what it’s like fighting, living and dying in such raw conditions as an active warzone. 
</p><p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> This book was haunting. A friend reminded me that the Nazi’s burned copies of this book and I think I understand why. It instills in me a strong disgust of war and its effects on the people fighting it. The generals and politicians that command it are so far removed from the stench and madness that is at the front line. Seeing how this completely upends the lives of simple self-determining people for the sake of ideas such as patriotism or profit, showed how futile the prospect of war could be. The fascinating takeaway of this book is a strong anti-war stance.
