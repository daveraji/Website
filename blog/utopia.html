<h1>Utopia</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#utopia'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='utopia.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there such a thing as a perfect political system? What might that system look like? 
</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The book is from the point of view of a European traveler who is recounting tales from his travels to the new world with peers. He recounts an experience with a people in a place called Utopia. He describes the systems and norms of the location. The insinuation is that to live here is to experience a perfect society. One that is perfectly just and fair. 
</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> The idea that this “Utopian” society would actually be horrible to live in. If you think about it, people need permission to do just about anything (travel, marry, work) and follow very stringent rules with the threat of being cast into slavery. Which, by the way, is how the book bypasses all concepts of ill in the society. Ironically the idea of this collective paradis sacrifices the individual liberties of a person. Which brings the idea can we have a free Utopia? When everyone is free to do what they want but don’t end up subjugating the will of others?
