<p><b>The Question:</b> How do we fit into our personality types and how does that inform our interactions?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This is a book about the Enneagram. The book goes through each of the personality types and evaluates what
theyâ€™re like in childhood, under stress, when calm and safe. The book also gives famous examples with that personality
type, and makes predictions about how someone may be like at work or in a relationship. This is meant to help you see
your tendencies and better identify which personality type you adhere to.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea: </b>The idea that taking the personality test might be misleading. According to this book, when you take
the personality test, you sometimes answer in a way that is expected of you or what you want to be. I understand that
because as I read the descriptions, I saw myself in different personalities than just in the one that fit me best.</p>
