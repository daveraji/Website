<p><b>The Question:</b> What makes a good spiritual leader and how can I become one?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This is a great, simple and straight-forward book on leadership. I found it relevant to all leadership, not
just spiritual leadership. Breaks down leadership principles and methods of thinking about them.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Lots of good nuggets here. Big ones that I felt I needed to be reminded of time and again is prayer,
delegation and pride. Prayer as a tool to prepare for what you can’t see and just to involve God in your life. When you
micromanage and refuse to delegate, you’re robbing someone of the opportunity to grow and yourself of the opportunity to
have rest. Pride is just the downfall of even the best leader.</p>
