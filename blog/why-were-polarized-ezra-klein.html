<h1>Why We're Polarized - Ezra Klein</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#why-were-polarized-ezra-klein'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='why-were-polarized-ezra-klein.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question: </b> How do we define polarization? Has it been increasing and if so, what does that mean for
    American politics? </p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Ezra Klein is really smart. In this book, he walks us throught the history of polarization in
    America. The book talks about things that contribute to polarization as well as presents lots of psychological
    evidence to explain current trends and predict the future of politics. </p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> One of the compelling ideas was the breakdown of Identity Politics. Klein argues that
    conservatism in the US isn't a set of principles but actually an identity. It's reflected by how homogenous the
    American Republic party looks (mostly white middle-aged men). He argues that the Democrats have a harder time
    building a single-identity coalition like this so they have to moderate their tone, so what they say to encourage
    black people doesn't dissuade their Hispanic working-class coalition etc etc. This also kind of explains that phrase
    "Democrats fall in love, republicans fall in line." Party loyalty might be more pertinent when it's a big part of
    the group identity.</p>
