<p><b>The Question:</b> What is an up-to-date snapshot of International Development?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This is a book about world facts. What is the actual state of world development in 2019. The writer explains
in-depth how we are all relying on outdated misconceptions about how poor the global south is and this book does an up
to date assessment on where people are at in global development.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> That the idea of ‘developed’ countries and ‘developing’ countries is outdated. Instead there’s a 4
tiered system that better breaks down wealth from the absolute poorest to ‘middle income’ countries and then rich
countries. Most people are actually in the top half, vase majority in the top 3 with a few billion in abject poverty.
Also even within so-called ‘rich’ countries, you find people across that spectrum (usually the top two tiers).</p>
