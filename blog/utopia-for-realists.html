<h1>Utopia for Realists</h1>

<p><b>The Question:</b> Can we build a better, more equitable world purely based on science?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book assesses what it’s like to build a Utopian state through idealistic governance. Mainly focuses on
universal basic income, shorter work weeks and open borders. This book evaluates ways to implement these ideals and
why/how it might contribute to creating utopia.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Universal basic income for all people seems to be the books most daring and pertinent topic. It’s
presenting the argument and using cases from around the world to justify it. From GiveDirectly’s work in rural Kenya and
even a Canadian experiment in a small Manitoban community.</p>
