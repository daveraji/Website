<h1>Progress and Poverty</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#progress-and-poverty'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='progress-and-poverty.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why is it that as countries increase in progress, there is more inequality? Shouldn’t there be an ushering of universal benefits that uplift everyone? Why is there still poverty? 
</p><p><b>Summary:</b> This book basically gives you a masterclass in economic fundamentals and then beats down certain concepts to help build Henry George’s argument about progress and why it doesn't necessarily help poverty. 
</p><p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> The main idea of the book is honestly revolutionary. George’s main conclusion is that the reason for poverty in a sufficiently progressed society is the private ownership of land. If there was a way for you to share the inherent profits of land with the whole populace, then people wouldn’t be incentivized to sit on parcels of land and contribute nothing in terms of productivity while gaining land values. He has a compelling illustration of how all productivity gained in a progressive society ends up going to rent. +1 for implementing land value taxes and also universal basic income to evenly distribute the value!
