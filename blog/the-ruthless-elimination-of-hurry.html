<p><b>The Question:</b> How can I live a more rested life and avoid burnout?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book gives the argument for slowing down in life. It breaks down the dangers of hurry and how it hurts us,
our lives and our faith. Then goes through practical steps on slowing down. There’s no rush. You’ll make less mistakes
and it makes everyday life so much more manageable.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> One of the ideas in this book is just incorporating the lack of hurry into everyday life. General
patience. Not jay-walking, not checking your phone when waiting in line for a sec, breathing slow, arriving early,
walking/biking instead of driving. Reading the book in itself was a leisure endeavor and it really biblically sold me on
this lifestyle of calm and leisure.</p>
