<p><b>The Question: </b>Of all the diets, which is the healthiest and the best for living long and healing?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book uses the scientific method to convince the reader that raw plant based food is the best for health.
There is a China study especially where the whole raw plant based diet showed incredible results in helping people with
chronic health issues.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> This book made some insaaaane claims about the healing properties of whole plant-based diets.
Reversing diabetes, curing cancers, reducing seizures just miracle cure levels of healing and did a decent job pointing
to scientific papers that backed itâ€™s ideas. Needs some research</p>
