<p><b>The Question:</b> Why are men the way that they are?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is a collection of essays about feminism. Absolutely solid. It’s author is credited for the word
‘mansplaining’, although she apparently isn’t a big fan of its use. From microagressions to violence against women and a
crystal clear explanation of how they’re all woven together. Book really helped paint a picture of the butterfly effect
of misogynist violence. How letting this joke slide now relates to acts of physical violence against women later.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea: </b>Reading this book was just a total revelation. Being a better ally definitely starts with knowledge.
I’m low-key ashamed to say, I wasn’t as knowledgeable as I thought on women’s studies and history. Understand the
pattern and you can more quickly call it out. Understand the history and you can better empathize with the gravitas of
the inequality. Also big-ups to the author for acknowledging and discussing the different experiences of feminism for
Black and Indigenous women. Highly recommend the read.</p>
