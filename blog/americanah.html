<small>[<a href='../blog.html#americanah'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='americanah.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question: </b>Who is Ifemelu and how can you marry her American and Nigerian identities?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> A high-energy, full personality Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, moves to America. Difficulties and complexities of
life ensue. Then moves back to Nigeria as grown-up Americanah. In addition to cultural touchstone it doubles as a
complex love story.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea: </b>Thereâ€™s a lot of loves in this book and as confident and bombastic the main character is, she suffers
from a lack of self-reflection. In a lot of the instances, I found myself being sympathetic to the people and families
that were hurt along the way from reckless behaviour in pursuit of feelings.</p>
