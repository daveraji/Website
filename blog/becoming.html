<p><b>Question:</b> Who is Michelle Obama?</p> 
<p><b>Summary:</b> Michelle Obama is a badass, but she’s also just a woman that’s trying her best. She does a great job telling us
about her upbringing and showing us a deeply relatable version of her life story. Honestly, reading this book made me
realize that most people that I look up to are incredibly lucky, normal and approachable. Barack seemed like such a
force of nature tho.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea: </b>The book emphasizes a commitment to trying your best and also being transparent about failures. One
major takeaway about Michelle’s life is that you don’t have to be perfect to be good and have a great impact in the
world. Sometimes even our heroes are just people trying their best.</p>
