<h1>Walkable City - Jeff Speck</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#walkable-city-jeff-speck'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='walkable-city-jeff-speck.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>Question: </b>How can we improve our lives through the places that we live in? How important are walkable cities in the equation of life satisfaction and happiness? 
</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Jeff does a fantastic job outlining the boons of living in a walkable city. He explains how it’s good for our health, wealth, joy and overall life. The book attempts a compelling argument that we should attempt to live in walkable communities or advocate for making our current communities much more walkable. 
</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Honestly, this book is going to inform where I live for the foreseeable future. After reading the chapter on biking I sold the motorized scooter I used to ride and bought a single speed bicycle. Initially my range on it was much lower than the 17 miles of the scooter and I arrived at destinations sweaty but after a few weeks, I found myself biking across municipalities, finding good neighborhoods, getting useful accessories and enjoying my commute. I’ve also been able to look around my city a lot more and learn about how things look from ground level while saving tons of money. It’s walkable neighborhoods for me here on out, no more excuses.
