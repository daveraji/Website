<p><b>Summary:</b> This is a book by Jose Rizal about the Filipino people under subjugation by Spain. He speaks from his own experience about the Philippines and how her people are to rise up against the Spaniards. He outlines things Spain can do to form a new relationship with the Filipino people and describes predictions about the relationships that the Philippines as a nation can develop in the future.

<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Reading this book honestly led me to think about the idea of emancipation of black people under oppression. Obviously, that idea of oppression is more acute in the colonized Philippines than the subjugation of North American black people. That said, there were parallels to Jose Rizalâ€™s calls for emancipation that mimicked the civil rights movement. Very inspirational and conversely very similar end to MLK Jr.
