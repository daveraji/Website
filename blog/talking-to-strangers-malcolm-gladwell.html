<p><b>The Question:</b> Do we actually understand strangers and how can we better judge people we don’t know?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> When talking to strangers we make quite a bit of assumptions that we wouldn’t make about ourselves. We’re
overconfident in how well we can judge strangers and that leads to gross misjudgements of character. The book goes
through many examples breaking down how we’re often wrong and the biases that make us wrong.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> So many good ones in this book. How police investigators/FBI agents who are tasked to discover lies
are most gullible when people’s emotions don’t match their expressions. Due to this, it’s sometimes more reliable to use
raw data to judge character instead of the reputation/expectations of someone tasked with interviewing a stranger.</p>
