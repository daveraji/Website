<p><b>Question:</b> Is there a healthier way to use the technology that is now ubiquitous in our lives? 
</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Cal Newport is the award-winning writer of Deep Work where he goes into ideas about working efficiently on complicated topics. That book and concept was a bit too “pie in the sky” for me to grasp but the concepts in Digital Minimalism are beyond practical. His description of the problem of rampant algorithms, lost hours and mindless scrolling resonate so well with me that it sometimes feels like he’s directly talking about me. He presents tools and thought processes on how to free yourself from the tyranny of your tech. 
</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Your technology is a tool. Unfortunately there are really smart people that are paid LOTS of money to think of ways for you to be trapped spending more and more time on your phone than you’d like, but that doesn’t change the fact that your phone is a tool. Newport suggests greyscalling, deleting useless notifications, blocking apps any way you know how - basically take back control of your tool. I found this to be very effective in using my phone for what I actually want instead of waking up hours later realizing I got lost in the looking glass guided by a really good algorithm.
