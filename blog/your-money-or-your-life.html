<p><b> The Question:</b> How do I get a better relationship with money? </p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The last budgeting book that you’ll ever need. It approaches budgeting by asking you how much money you really need. Then it starts getting philosophical in it’s questions about your life, what you really want and how you want to live. The book explains that money is a tool and that it’s main purpose is to give you the life you want. So it implores you to think about cutting out the excess in your life and focus it on true financial freedom which is having the freedom to do exactly what you want with your time. </p>
<p><b>Fascinating idea:</b> That money is interchangeable with life energy. 
You want to be doing exactly what you want with you life and financial freedom is understanding that and being free from vocational obligations
