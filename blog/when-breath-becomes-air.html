<h1>When Breath Becomes Air</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#when-breath-becomes-air'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='when-breath-becomes-air.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question:</b> What's it like to die? How does the process of dying inform life?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> The book follows an aspiring brain surgeon who finds out that he has a late stage metastasized brain cancer.
Paul Kalanithi tells his life and his story through diagnoses and finally death. This book was just gut-wrenching. So
real. Incredibly beautiful and relevant. Reading this made me want to take back my time from inconsequential activities
like social media and mindless tv. Also Paul was a great writer, him talking about life and legacy really helped open my
mind and think about life's bigger questions and answers.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> In the book, Paul describes this panic when he realizes that he's been preparing for a role
(neurosurgeon) that inherently takes a long, long time to realize and that he went through the grind but will miss out
on the glory. He talks about loving your work, embracing the journey. Changed how I thought about my career. Less as a
destination to reach but more as a story to enjoy in the present. Also, finding things I enjoy now, instead of just
constantly delaying gratification for delaying sake. Take vacations, leave toxic environments, spend some money on
yourself; this book left me with the idea that life is short so we ought to enjoy the journey.</p>
