<h1>The Smart Enough City</h1>

<p><b>The Question:</b> Are we trippin’? Why do we need all this useless technology in our cities? Is it even really helpful or is
getting in the way of our actual civic work and endangering our privacy?</p>
<p><b>Summary: </b>This book talks about city tech. Basically goes through examples of city bureaucrats adding public space wifi,
cameras everywhere or “AI” to cities in order to bring them up to date. The book talks about “tech goggles” that people
sometimes have where they just think that adding more tech to something will immediately make it better. Turns out
that’s not the case, sometimes.. Well, often actually - it makes it worse. This book talks about some downright terrible
examples of that *cough* sidewalk labs *cough* and then at the end highlights some good use cases!</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Privacy considerations of using technology in the public domain. People can use taxi data to find out
who frequents strip clubs and then extort them and ruin their political careers, for some reason. Police use facial
recognition data to punish people for attending protests against police brutality. Fighting the idea that there is
police brutality by.. being brutal. This book did a great job of explaining the importance of privacy and why you should
care about it even if you believe you have nothing to hide.</p>
