<h1>The Feminine Mystique</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#the-feminine-mystique'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='the-feminine-mystique.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>The Question: </b>Why is it that 40 years after the women's suffrage movement and the “first wave” of feminism, more women
than ever felt unfulfilled with how limited the scope of their lives were.</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> Betty Freidman is a research juggernaut. This book is just throwing haymakers in terms of examples and case
studies on and one. Now, I’m not necessarily privy to the world of these upper-middle class white women from the 60’s,
but Betty paints a distinctly human experience in their frustrations. She makes her points that women should be a more
prominent part of global society by drawing from a ton of research, and a veritable cacophony of voices/interviews.
Realtalk, this book was longer than I thought it’d be. There was just *so much* content. If anyone is trying to
understand that second wave, RBG, ERA type of white feminism - this book is their bible.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Betty takes on Freud in a way that I hadn’t thought about before. It was a great chapter about how
Freud’s biological conclusions are bogus especially when it comes to how it determined women’s interactions. She
straight up says that Freud doesn’t understand women. I totally believe it! She talked about his strange relationship
with his own wife, mother and sisters. How those power imbalances informed his perceptions. She even critiques how his
actions aren’t even consistent with his own findings. Definitely made me second guess that version of
pseudo-intellectualism and behavioural psychology.</p>
