<p><b>The Question:</b> What’s the right way to date as a Christian person?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> A knowledgeable assessment of Christian dating. The subject of many a disgruntled believer. If the bible talks
a big game about marriage, what does it say about dating?</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> Christian dating is evaluating whether this person is someone that you can marry. Being very diligent
in the task of assessing if they can be there through life’s twists and turns. You might do everything right, follow the
guidance to the letter and things might still fall apart. That’s why the most important part is prayer.</p>
