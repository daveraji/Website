<p><b>The Question:</b> What does Silicon Valley look like to the world? What's up with this place and culture?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is the memoir of Anna Weiner. She is initially a floating 25 year old in NYC working at some dead-end jobs in publishing. She joins a startup, and this starts her adventure through Silicon Valley. She ends up having a pure silicon valley experience: startup grinds, lucrative acquisitions and even becoming good friends with founders. Throughout the experience she asks, “what's the point?”.</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> One thing that this author gets at without mentioning outright, is the idea that very few ideas in silicon valley are actually novel. Uber is taxis, Airbnb is a bed and breakfast, social media is just human interactions and sharing, and even github was already being done before - the main provision is that these things are now centralized. Fundamentally, the actions that humans take aren't all that different. The change is that we do it all through one device and we’re tracked while doing it. I guess this always presents a possibility to opt out since the world isn’t really that different when you do.
