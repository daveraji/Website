<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is meant to help you simplify your life and achieve your dreams faster and easier. Very conventional self help book in that sense but its method is simple, cut out anything unnecessary. You can do this in a few ways: Consistently challenge assumptions you have about what you want, get really, *really* good at saying no, and focus on your yes with full focus. 
</p>
<p><b>Fascinating Idea:</b> This whole book was really convincing to me to be honest. This reminded me of the Ruthless Elimination of Hurry and the question of keeping the main thing the main thing. Greg McKeown does not pull punches and is very direct in the action items in this book. Highlights were the chapters on making a mission statement, saying no graciously and the idea that you should even say no to *good* things that aren’t the essential thing. I’m learning more and more that my time is being constantly siphoned and I can't do the things that I, myself, deem essential. Very impactful book.
