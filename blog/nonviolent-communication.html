<h1>NonViolent Communication</h1>
<small>[<a href='../blog.html#nonviolent-communication'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='nonviolent-communication.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p><b>Question:</b> How can you have a better approach to communication to better address the needs of all parties without causing people to get defensive?</p>
<p><b>Summary:</b> This book is trying to help anyone better communicate their needs effectively and help the people in their lives to recognize those needs and emotions as well as become biased to help them. The book goes through different techniques that help the reader efficiently let people know how they feel while avoiding the pitfalls that conventionally can lead to people getting defensive and avoiding resolution or even an understanding. The methods are used for handling conflict and unpleasant feelings and also expressing gratitude and explaining positive emotions. The book also goes through examples of these techniques in action which helps paint a picture of what our world could look like with more effective Non-violent communication. The book helps you to communicate with others and yourself using the following framework: I feel [emotion], when you [did specific action] and this stems from [universal need that explains my reaction to the event].

<p><b>Fascinating idea:</b> When I read this book I thought it'd help me communicate with others. What it really helped me do was introspect so much better. I had to take a majority of my time here thinking about what my needs actually are and how to actually put them into words. Also getting in tune with my emotions on a discrete level. I initially referred to every bad emotion as nervous instead of disappointment, angry, disgusted etc. A chart doing the breakdown of different emotions helped me better understand my own feelings.
